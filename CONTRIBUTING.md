of things running concurrently:

   ```
   yarn playground
   ```
2. Watch and rebuild theatre packages on changes:
   ```sh
   cd theatre
   yarn build:js
   ```

## Workflow

> This section is lacking in instructions (PRs welcome!).

1. Find (or create) an issue you would like to look at
2. Implement the changes & test it against
3. Run the tests to ensure that nothing has been broken
4. Create a PR & reference the issue ðŸŽ‰
